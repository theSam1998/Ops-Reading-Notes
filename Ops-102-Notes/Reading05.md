## Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?</br>
- <b> these terms all refer to the text UI used to designate actions within the PC. Just like in the early days of computing, it is more efficient and less costly on hardware to perform these actions through the terminal as opposed to through the GUI, as actions that would take multiple steps within the GUI can be shortened to a command the length of a sentence (eg. creating a folder, placing a file within that folder, naming that file and placing text within it could all be done from a single line within the terminal).
- CLI is an abbreviation of command line interface. This is a type of text based interface used by the shell, which is a program that, by wikipedias definition, exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs. To summarize, the shell is a program that allows you to give text based commands to your device that will perform designated functions within the OS of that device through the use of a CLI.
- A command prompt is the input field in a text based user interface. It is where the command will be entered and received by the computer to perform the designated action.
## What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?</br>
- <b> change directories is cd, list contents is ls, mv can both rename and move a file, depending on the commands that follow. For example, to move a file, you would type mv, followed by the file name, followed by the directory you intend to move it to. to rename said file, you would type mv, followed by the filename, followed by the new filename.

## What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?</br>
- <b> a relative path operates solely from the directory you are currently operating in, while an absolute path operates directly from the root, following the specified path from there.
## Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.
- <b> If we compare the two systems to physical architecture, Windows would be akin to a large corporate skyscraper, with multiple levels, systems and corporate layers accessible only by certain designations of employee. In this kind of building, even a high ranking employee may not be able to access all the necessary features and functions of said building without operating through other parties. Linux, by contrast to this, is like a small office you built yourself from the ground up. You would be aware of where everything is and how to use it, as it was built from an easily provided framework by you, for you. There are much fewer floors (representing layers which information is fed through) in the Linux office than there are in the Windows office, meaning one employee could operate all functions within the building directly and quickly without passing through multiple levels of arbitrary corporate policies.

## Things I want to know more about
- Why would an industry professional prefer to use linux over windows?
- How is linux safer than other operating systems while simultaneously having less layers for commands to pass through in order to be completed successfully?
- What advantages do open source programs offer over non open source ones?
- What would a programmer or hacker be able to do in linux that they would not be able to do in other operating systems?
