## <b> What is Ubuntu? <b>
- Ubuntu is a free to use, open source Operating system developed in 2004 by Mark Shuttleworth. He wanted to make Debian (another existing linux distribution at the time) more user friendly, so he put together a team known today as Canonical Ltd to develop Ubuntu. The OS is designed to be extremely versatile and customizable by the user, making it ideal for a wide variety of purposes, and a top choice of industry professionals.
## <b> Why would you choose to install the LTS version over regular Ubuntu releases? <b>
- LTS offers better security and reliability by keeping everything the same within the OS as long as possible and Only providing necessary bug fixes/security updates/other necessary support. They are provided with these services for five years, and will remain extremely stable for that time. A new version of LTS is released every two years. This high stability and security makes it ideal for use by system admins, web hosts and software engineers (https://www.makeuseof.com/why-use-ubuntu-lts-releases/). The LTS version makes it easier to receive help from Canonical and other users, which is another reason it may be desireable to industry professionals who would value stability and proper service over bells, whistles and fancy graphics.
## <b> What is the Ubuntu GNOME Shell? <b>
- the GNOME shell is a type of GUI used by Linux and some other Unix-like Operating systems (this refers to linux as well as other OS's that operate in a similar manner to the UNIX kernel).
