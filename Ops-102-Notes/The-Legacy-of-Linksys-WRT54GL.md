# The Legacy of Linksys WRT54GL
--- 
## What makes the Linksys WRT54GL famous?
- it is famous for being an extremely reliable, open source (allowing it to easily be modified to suit different purposes), stackable router that holds the same level of functionality for periods of years, even decades. These routers are extremely popular among both hobbyists and those setting up/managing office computing environments, in which many devices need to be connected to the same network. Multiple WRT54GL models could be literally stacked on top of one another, and then configured further to perform the desired functions for the setting in which they operate. These models run on linux, and due to the nature of using a device running on open source code, it will be extremely easy to receive customer support for this model, whether from linksys or from the hobbyist community. Its versatility is lended to further by being able to broadcast on both 2.4g and 5g channels, allowing users to skirt some limitations that may be imposed by choosing one option over the other. On top of that, it is like an example of successful evolution, having remained largely unchanged since its conception in 2004
## Given it’s age, why do people continue to buy the Linksys WRT54GL?
- It can function well on modern networks, it is affordable (while some other routers may be cheaper, they also might not offer the same level of reliability, which leads into the fact that), you are practically guarunteed reliability and support when purchasing a WRT54GL, and if it is not functioning as you intended it to, modified source code can be easily flashed to the router. Also, this router has Wireless functionality, allowing it to broadcast data to a larger number of devices without being physically tethered to them, and both it's speed and range are well regarded and sufficient for many modern tasks, even when considering competition from more advanced, modern models.
## What does the “WRT54GL” stand for in the name?
- WRT designates that the device is a Wireless RouTer, as it can operate via broadcasting signals rather than solely rely on physical connections to network devices. The 54 indicates the speed the device is limited to in mbps, the G is short for 802.11g, which is the wifi standard the device uses, and the L of course stands for linux.
## What did Linksys sell before routers?
- Before routers, Linksys was a company that manufactured ethernet hubs (like early routers that functioned via hardware connection exclusively), ethernet cords, and network cards. However, they got their start as a company producing devices that linked multiple pcs to printers, so they've always had a hand in networking devices.
## When did Linksys preview their first consumer router?
- They previewed the device that would become known as a router, then called the Integrated Internet Hub, in 1999 at the COMDEX conference.
## Who suggested to name it a “router”?
- Bill Gates himself mentioned it in a passing comment at the COMDEX conference in 1999. Thank god he made this suggestion, as Integrated Internet Hub is a real mouthful.
## What happened when Cisco replaced the Linux-based firmware with the VxWorks platform?
- People could no longer flash modified source code to the Routers as easily, and so they nearly entirely cut out their hobbyist market, before re-releasing the device as the WRT54GL, featuring the same specs but with open source code so it could be easily modified to suit a wide range of uses.
## Why doesn’t the WRT54GL model need to be modified to abide by the new FCC rules?
- It can operate on both 2.4 and 5 g channels, and 5g broadcasting is what the brunt of the new FCC rules affect.
## Does the WRT54GL model still get updates from Linksys?
- Yes and no. They do still release updates, but it seems to be quite sporadically, as the most recent software available on the linksys website was released in january of 2016

## Things I want to know more about
- What are the advantages and disadvantages when looking at different models of router/types of internet connection?
- When would it be a better choice to use a different router?
- What are the best situations in which to use a WRT54GL, and what are the worst?
- What does having open source software improve on a router? <br>
The open source community provides network protection and a longer shelf-life for the device that is responsible for protecting all your devices, internet, and personal data. Imagine improved and increased network stability (no more reboots), advanced bandwidth, wireless signal controls, and more. - quote from https://www.flashrouters.com/router-basics/open-source-firmware
- How does a kernel function within something like a WIFI router?
- what are the benefits to flashing/modifying the software on that router, how are some ways you could get it to perform more according to your needs using this?
