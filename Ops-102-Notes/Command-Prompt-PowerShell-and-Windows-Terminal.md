# Command Prompt, PowerShell, and Windows Terminal
--- 
## What is the Command Prompt?
- The command prompt is a command line interpreter native to most windows distributions. This means it can be used to interpret text commands to directly interact with the file system of the PC. It operates by running the appropriate batch file or executable for the command given. This makes it extremely useful for performing actions within the filesystem quickly, or solving issues that cannot be accessed through the normal GUI.
## How do I access the Command Prompt?
- You can press r while holding the win key, and type "CMD" into the box that appears, or you could press the windows home button and search for the command line, console or cmd.exe through there.
## What are some of the most commonly used commands?
- chdsk, copy, cd, del, mkdir, ftp, ping, tracert, attrib, net, dir, help, and shutdown, many of which were directly listed by the article at https://www.lifewire.com/command-prompt-2625840
## What is Windows Power Shell?
- Windows PowerShell is a more advanced command line interpreter relative to cmd, and may hopefully replace cmd. It supplements the functionality of cmd.exe by recognizing a greater amount of commands from other operating systems, making it more friendly to users who transition between multiple systems.
## What is Windows Terminal?
- Windows Terminal is an application that can run several command line SHELLS native to windows and allows quick and easy changing between them.
"Any application that has a command line interface can be run inside Windows Terminal. This includes everything from PowerShell and Command Prompt to Azure Cloud Shell and any WSL distribution such as Ubuntu or Oh-My-Zsh." - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/
therefore, Windows terminal can be used to Execute commands across various systems quickly and easily and can be customized to create a more efficient and user-friendly experience overall.
