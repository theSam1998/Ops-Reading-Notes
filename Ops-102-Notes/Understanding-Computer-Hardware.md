# Understanding Computer Hardware
---
It is of the utmost importance to have an understanding of how the tools you're working with function, down to their core. This module is helping to familiarize us with our machines and their parts, so that the inner workings of computers are no longer alien to us.</br>
## Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?</br>
- <b> It seems to depend on the intended use of the computer the CPU is housed in. For PCs intended only to run individual tasks, a lower amount of cores can actually mean faster processing, where as more cores are better for multitasking, like running multiple programs at a time. 4 seems to be the sweet spot for modern pcs, as single core CPUs are not recommended per google search results. However, only 2 are required for a functional device.</br>
## What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?</br>
- <b> It is important to first check to ensure that the socket on the motherboard will accept the CPU. Once this is confirmed, other features can be sought out such as bluetooth, wifi capability and space for a good amount of ram, but by and far the most important thing is to ensure that the CPU socket is manufactured by the same company as your CPU, or otherwise compatible with it. </br>
## What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device? </br>
- <b> SSDs tend to have connectors for various other cables as well as SATA, which opens more options when building your PC. An SSD is faster, but a Hard drive is slightly more secure, due to its ability to easily be securely completely wiped of data. Hard drives also can have higher storage capacities than SSDs, making them ideal for storing large amounts of data. In short, the trade offs to consider are security and storage vs speed and connectivity.
## Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?</br>
The CPU is the brain of the computer, with the RAM acting like the space for thoughts and the SSD acting like the space for memories and experiences. The graphics card is like the optical nerve, and the fans are like your sweat glands, meant to keep the body cool. The motherboard is akin to the nervous system, transmitting information from one piece of the body to another. The power supply acts as the heart, providing power to the body and brain, while the case is like the skin, keeping all the organs housed in a nice hardy package to protect them from the outside world. </br>
### Things I want to know more about
- how does a cpu work, and what are threads?
- are hard drives going to remain in use in the future? what are the advantages of using a hard drive in combination with an ssd
- what is thermal paste and why does it exist
