# Code Fellows Ops Notes and Readings
---
## Summary
 *Through my journey with the Ops curriculum at Code Fellows, we were taught to learn proper cybersecurity principles through active experimentation and hands on learning, as well as through reading insightful and informative articles and watching videos on the subjects we study in order to supplement the learning we receive in lecture. I have put this repository together to serve as an easy way to access all of these readings in one place, assigning names to the files that reflect their content to make them easier to find, and filling in any incomplete details or unanswered questions.*
