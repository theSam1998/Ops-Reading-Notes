# Amazon EC2 and Cloud Security
---
## Statement addressing why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module:
- 1st article: clarifies the usefulness of virtualization, allowing otherwise resource intensive services to run off existing hardware through the virtualization layer. clarifies the relationship between ec2 and virtualization, and how ec2 is made possible by virtualization.
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a cloud computing service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual computers on which they can run their own applications. EC2 provides users with complete control over the virtual computing environment, including the operating system, network, and storage configuration. Users can choose from a variety of pre-configured machine images, or create their own custom images, and launch virtual machines (known as instances) as needed. EC2 instances are billed on an hourly basis, with different pricing options based on instance type, operating system, and usage characteristics.

- 2nd: ec2 can generate virtual servers, aka instances. helps with powering applications. pay as you use, and has a wide variety of virtual hardware and software available. It has a user friendly interface, and offers customizability as part of the process of setting up an instance. this essentially offers pre made customizable vms already configured for common industry tasks. between 1 and 100,000 instances can all be made to run sharing the same hardware. ec2 automatically configures a firewall for each instance.

- 3rd: the cloud is a shared resource, so it requires a distinctive security. it requires essentially a security dialogue across the board, requiring authentication for the applications as well as persistent verification. cloud based applications are more flexible and easier to maintain. different authentication levels are needed, as there can be varying levels of privileges for different users, ie. accessing sensitive data vs actually making system changes. most of these security dialogues are automated, both enabling ease of use and removing human error. cloud services must be easily integrated into other services. security services in particular must be easy to use, quick to learn, and provide instant value.
## Summarize and explain this topic via an analogy from your previous work or home experience:
- cloud computing is a difficult thing to compare to any previous experience I've had, though I can attempt to draw an analogy: Cloud computing would be like if every fisherman in the world stored their tackle in an infinitely large, invisible, easily accessible tackle box. Each user would be easily able to access the resources they need quickly without carrying extra unnecessary weight. However, having all these users data in one place would require effective and automated authentication to provide proper access to exclusively YOUR tackle, and prevent other users from accessing your gear. OpenAI has been having troubles recently with users accidentally accessing other users data, such as conversation history as well as a recent debacle where paid users were shown the payment information for other users in their account settings. I believe this is due to improper structuring of cloud authentication, and plays into that analogy nicely: without proper security infrastructure in cloud computing, you could head to the lake one day to do some trout fishing with your brand new gear, and open the invisible tacklebox to find the expensive custom tuna lures of a florida angler. An honest user would simply attempt to reconnect to their own gear, while a dishonest user could potentially pull these resources out and sell them. For both parties, the day on the water is ruined until the error is fixed.

## Things I want to know more about
- How does virtualization work to save resources? We've played with virtual machines quite a bit at this point, but I'm not sure I understand how they do what they do.
- How do cloud security infrastructures work? 
- How are the authentication dialogues and constant streams of verification automated in ec2?
